# Cloud Functions Reliability Samples (Node.js)

This repository contains code samples that demonstrate how to improve the
reliability of your Cloud Functions:

*   [Retries](retries) - retrying Cloud Functions on failure.
*   [Idempotency](idempotency) - making Cloud Functions idempotent.
*   [Order processing](order-processing) - a sample restaurant order processing
    system built on Cloud Functions, which makes use of retries and idempotency.
